<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The DPS Society is a non-profit, non-proprietary, private, educational organization. This Global Network of over 200 English medium, co-educational, secular schools provides education from Pre-Nursery/Nursery to Class XII. The DPS Family – with its transcontinental identity, is not merely a list of institutions, persons or facts; it is a network of values, systems and relationships.

  The DPS Family: Building on Collective Strengths For more than six decades, the DPS Society has developed with a spirit and a vision. Today it stands as a citadel of learning and a harbinger of quality consciousness, committed to developing the minds and initiatives of children. The family is growing every day.

  <H2>History</H2>
  <p>Once in a way dreaming the impossible may be the most practical thing to do. The report of the education commission on the emergence of an egalitarian and integrated society, spoke of a dream, a dream every committed educationist in India has, a dream of providing quality education to children in every part of our vast country. This very same dream is what inspires the Delhi Public School Society to nurture a family of over 200 schools even in the remotest, most inaccessible parts of the country and abroad.

  </p>
  <p>From the beginning in the President's Estate in 1941 as Church High School to Naveen Bharat School in 1947 and finally in 1949 at its present location on Mathura Road, DPS has traversed a long journey. The birth of a new nation in 1947 was in a way the beginning of DPS (called Naveen Bharat then), a momentous time in the history of our nation, when a beginning was made to fulfil a social, national need. DPS Mathura Road was the only school till DPS R.K.Puram came into being in 1972. Over 200 schools that followed are simple assertions of the strength that is DPS. Yet what has remained unchanged is the zest and spirit to achieve and to excel. As it has been said, “It is good to have an end to journey towards, but it is the journey that matters, in the end."</p>
